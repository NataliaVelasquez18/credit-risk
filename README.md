# PREDICTING CREDIT RISK

Loans are an essential part of modern society.  Arround the world  people borrow money to buy a home, car, travel, open a business, etc.  Loans are an opportunity but at the same time a challenge for banks.  On one hand loans create revenue with the interest regenerated, on the other hand, they create risk that borrowers won't repay loans and banks will loose money.  


## Business Case

PureLending is a financial institution with more than 30 years in the market.  It relies in measures like income, credit scores, and collateral assets to asses lending risk.  Through the years, the company has experimented a rise in default loans.  In the previous year default loans added $34M. The company has decided to address the issue and have hired a consulting firm to recommend the best strategy moving forward.  The firm has recommended to explore using machine learning to asses credit risk.

## Purpose

The purpose of this study is to build several machine learning models employing different techniques and compare them to recommend whether PureLending should switch from the traditional way of approving loan applications.  If the recommendation is to use machine learning then, the best performing model will be recommended. 


## Executive summary



## Overview of Approach

In the study we used the credit card credit dataset from PureLending.   Python and Scikit-learn were used to predict credit risk.  
Evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk
compare stranghts and weaknesses and asses how well a model can predict

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, you’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, you’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, you’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once you’re done, you’ll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
